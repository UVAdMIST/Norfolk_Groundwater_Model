# Norfolk_Groundwater_Model
This repository contains scripts to model and forecast the groundwater table level in Norfolk, Virginia using Long Short-term Memory and Recurrent neural networks. These models are created with Tensorflow and Keras and run on a HPC with an Nvidia p100 GPU. The modeling process has been broken into three steps: preprocessing, modeling, and post-processing.
